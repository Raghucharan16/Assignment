# Product Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive **Product Recommendation System** that suggests similar products based on user selection. The system uses both **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering** techniques with a clean, interactive Streamlit UI.

**Use Case**: "You bought Product A → You may also like Product B, C..."

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop content-based recommendations using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- Implement collaborative filtering using matrix factorization (SVD)
- Create an intuitive web interface for product recommendations
- Provide comprehensive analysis and evaluation of recommendation models

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Content-Based Filtering (Mandatory)
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Analyzes product titles, descriptions, categories, and brands
- **Cosine Similarity**: Finds products with similar characteristics
- **Top-K Recommendations**: Returns the most similar products with similarity scores
- **Feature Analysis**: Shows which features contribute most to similarity

### 👥 Collaborative Filtering (Bonus)
- **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**: User-product rating predictions
- **User Profiling**: Analyzes user preferences and rating patterns
- **Similar Users**: Finds users with similar tastes
- **Cold Start Handling**: Manages new users and products gracefully

### 🎨 Interactive UI (Streamlit)
- **Product Selector**: Dropdown with all available products
- **Multiple Recommendation Types**: Content-based, collaborative, popular, category-based
- **Similarity Scores**: Optional display of recommendation confidence
- **User Profiles**: Shows user rating history and preferences
- **Category Browsing**: Explore products by category
- **Popular Products**: Trending items based on ratings

## 📊 Dataset

### Products Dataset (50 items)
Each product includes:
- **product_id**: Unique identifier
- **title**: Product name
- **description**: Detailed product description
- **category**: Product category (Electronics, Clothing, Books, etc.)
- **brand**: Manufacturer/brand name
- **price**: Product price
- **rating**: Average user rating (1-5)

### Ratings Dataset (500+ ratings)
User interaction data:
- **user_id**: Unique user identifier
- **product_id**: Product being rated
- **rating**: User rating (1-5 scale)
- **timestamp**: When the rating was made
